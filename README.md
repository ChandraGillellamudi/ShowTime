# It's ShowTime ðŸŽ¥

ShowTime displays your taps and gestures on screen, perfect for that demo or presentation. One file is all you need to massively improve your demos. ShowTime can even display how much force is applied for each touch.

ShowTime works best when mirroring your screen or recording through QuickTime. By default the size of the visual touches are 44pt. This mirrors Apple's guidelines for minimim hit size for buttons on iOS. You're free to change this, of course!

## Installation

- Step 1: Drop `ShowTime.swift` into your project or copy the contents of it whereever you like. 
- Step 2: There is no step 2; you're ready to go.

## Usage

ShowTime works out of the box, but you can customise it to turn it on or off (you could use this to have a demo environment),
change the colour and outline of the taps, and even choose whether to display the number of taps for multiple taps.
Here's a list of options:

- `ShowTime.itsShowTime`: Whether ShowTime is enabled (`true` by default)
- `ShowTime.fillColor`: The fill (background) colour of the touch circles
- `ShowTime.strokeColor`: The colour of the stroke (outline) of the touch circles
- `ShowTime.strokeWidth`: The width (thickness) of the stroke around the touch circles
- `ShowTime.size`: The size of the touch circles. The default is 44 x 44
- `ShowTime.showMultipleTapCount`: Whether the touch circles should indicate a multiple tap (i.e. show a number 2 for a double tap) (`false` by default)
- `ShowTime.multipleTapCountTextColor`: The colour of the text to use when showing multiple tap counts
- `ShowTime.showForce`: Whether the touch circles should visually show how much force is applied
